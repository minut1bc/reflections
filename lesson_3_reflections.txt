When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  One such case is often switching between PCs used for work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There are times when you don't want/need coommits that are on the GitHub repository, but not on your local repository. It could also be used to leave time in order to fix possible merging conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are best used when one wants to work upon another git user's repo, while giving credit to that user. Clones, when working for a personal project, and branches, when trying new features and fixes, which would later be merged with the master branch version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You can revert unwanted changes in the GitHub repo.
