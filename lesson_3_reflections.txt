When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  One such case is often switching between PCs used for work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There are times when you don't want/need coommits that are on the GitHub repository, but not on your local repository. It could also be used to leave time in order to fix possible merging conflicts.
