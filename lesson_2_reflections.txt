What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	You initialize the repository in order to use git, to keep track of older versions of the files in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	I belive files from the working directory that are in the staging area can still be edited, but would update the repository only when committed.
